*Mode: Online instructor sessions and teaching fellow sessions*

### Description

The course covers the following topics: forces and moments, free body diagrams, static analyses for trusses, beams, and frames, set theory and fundamental elements of probability theory, random variables, probabilistic
modeling, formulation of the reliability problem, and Monte Carlo Methods for simulations.

### Course Objective

For high school and undergraduate students, this course provides a solid base in static analysis, applied probability and Bayesian statistics as used by engineers. It introduces them to the increasingly important topic of
engineering risk analysis. For graduate students, in addition, this course provides a strong background for pursuing more advanced courses on non-deterministic methods.

### Program Schedule & What We Do

#### Week 1

Topic: Principle of statics and application to trusses


* Force and moments 


* Free body diagram


* Equilibrium and determinacy


* Truss analysis


* Planar trusses

In this week, we came to know each other in this group and decided to work together. Then we shared our perspectives concerning this project and started to make schedules about what we would do in the next few weeks.

#### Week 2

Topic: Shear and moment curves and application to beams and frames


* Shear curves


* Moment curves


* Beam analysis


* Frame analysis

In this week, we finished the lecture and our homework in time. By the way, all the contents in the lectures, mentor sessions and homework were drawn from Leet, K., Uang, C-M., and J. Lanning (2008). *Fundamentals of Structural Analysis.* McGraw-Hill Higher Education, New York, NY.

Two of us are juniors(Me and Atom), and Rick is about to be junior in the next term, so it is a fact that we have already learned all the contents in W1 and W2 in Mechanics of Materials and Structural Mechanics earlier. It's nothing new for us but in EnglishüòÅ

#### Week 3

Topic: Fundamental concepts of risk and probability


* Event


* Axioms of probability


* Elementary rules of probability


* Conditional probability and statistical independence


* Bayes' rule


* Therem of total probabilty


* Discret, continuous, and mixed random variables


* Probability distributions


* Partial descriptors of a random variable


* Common distribution models

In this week, we were asked to work on our final report: a full probabilistic analysis of a structure. At first, the requirements were kind of vague for us, so we selected a complicated truss bridge for a Bayesian Network construction. But we were unsure about our selection so we asked for the mentor for advice, he said that our structure was too complicated and it was supposed to be simple enough to accomplish all calculation by hand. Finally we simplified our structure and selected a rigid frame with $2^o$ indeterminancy for our analysis.

#### Week 4

Topic 4: Reliability analysis


* Introduction to Machine Learning


* Element of fragility analysis


* Limit-state functions


* Capacity and demand safety format


* Component vs. system reliability problems

In this week, we struggled with the promotion of our final project. At first, we were confused and quite aimless about the probabilistic analytical part of our report. And I thought I had a very deep understanding of what I've learned from the lesson *Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics* when I was a first-grade college student. So I constructed a hypothetical model for our probabilistic analysis. Then I identified the distribution of our teamwork and finished the probabilistic model construction by myself.


By the way, all the contents in the lectures, mentor sessions and homework were drawn from Ang, A. H-S., and W-H Tang (2007). *Probability Concepts in Engineering: Emphasis on Applications to Civil and Environmental Engineering.* John Wiley, New York, NY and Alpaydin E. *Introduction to machine learning.* MIT press, 2020. The knowledge in probabilistic part was almost identical to what I've learned from the lesson *Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics*, but it was not meant to be applied to engineer domain. Thus, I started to take the probabilistic analysis into account when thinking about structure design. The basic concepts in the lectures were nothing new but they provided me with new insight and inspired me to combined what I've learned before both in mathematics and engineering subjects.


As for the Machine Learning, I was so surprised that the professor mentioned something about ML. Compared to most of my companions, I've learned ML before both in class and after class, this subject was so attractive for me because I thought it was quite powerful and prospective. The course I've sttended before was set up by school of computer science so actually I didn't possess chances to apply ML to my major, structural engineer or structural mechanics. However, I see some probability in this project, so it's highly desirable for me to apply what I've acknowledged from ML to the final report and uncoming academic paper writing.
